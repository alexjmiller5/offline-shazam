# Canonical secrets manifest - 1Password secret references only, SAFE to commit.
# Release secrets (Developer ID signing, notarization, cask push) live in the
# SHARED "Apple Signing" vault - not the project vault. CI resolves them via
# 1password/load-secrets-action with this repo's OP_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_TOKEN
# (the project's -ci service account is granted read on BOTH vaults).
# Refs are BY NAME on purpose: op-project-bootstrap parses this file.
