# Offline Shazam

Native SwiftUI app for iOS 17+ and macOS 14+ (targets `OfflineShazam` and `OfflineShazamMac` share `App/` and `Shared/`; iOS-only APIs - ActivityKit, AudioRecordingIntent, AVAudioSession, UIKit - sit behind `#if os(iOS)`). Uses Apple ShazamKit to identify music while listening and persist offline signatures for automatic recognition on subsequent use. No third-party recognition service or Mac runtime dependency.

## Source and checks

`project.yml` is canonical; `.xcodeproj` and Info.plist are generated. Sources live in `App/`, unit/integration tests in `Tests/`, UI tests in `UITests/`. `just gen` resolves the XcodeGen executable's real path because Nix profile symlinks otherwise hide its bundled settings. Build output belongs outside a synced source checkout to avoid resource-fork signing failures.

Run `just test` (iOS simulator) and `just test-mac` (macOS, same tests minus Live Activity and notification suites) for real ShazamKit custom-catalog matching, durable queue behavior, Keychain, URLSession, and UI coverage. Simulator tests use local ad hoc signing so Keychain access has an application identity. `just check` builds without a developer account. Production Shazam catalog access and microphone behavior still need a provisioned phone smoke test.

Device signing and installation use caller-supplied `IOS_TEAM_ID`, `IOS_PROFILE`, `IOS_ACTIVITY_PROFILE`, and `IOS_DEVICE_ID`. The main app and embedded `.activity` extension need matching Distribution certificate/team/device profiles. A wildcard profile can sign the extension. `APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER` derives both bundle identifiers; widget Info.plist is generated and ignored. ShazamKit must be enabled as an App ID service in the Apple Developer account; it does not use a `com.apple.developer.shazamkit` entitlement. `just deploy` is the explicit local Ad Hoc build/install interface for the iPhone. The Mac app releases by tag through `.github/workflows/release.yml` (Developer ID + notarization + `offline-shazam` cask in the Homebrew tap, secrets from the shared Apple Signing vault via the `offline-shazam-ci` service account); `check.yml` runs `just check`, `just check-mac` and `just test-mac` on push. Pushing main does not deploy. Native account sign-in and microphone permission remain user state.

## Queue invariants

- Start a new capture promptly; backlog work must not delay recording.
- Feed microphone audio to native ShazamKit streaming recognition while generating the offline signature from the same audio. Stop early on a match; retain useful audio if recognition fails or connectivity drops.
- Persist the signature file and SwiftData record before saying saved.
- Await recognition within the app or App Intent lifetime. Never start detached recognition and return from an intent. iOS 18+ capture conforms to AudioRecordingIntent and LiveActivityIntent; its ActivityKit recording activity must exist throughout microphone use. The widget shares only activity/intent declarations, never credentials or queue state. iOS 17 uses foreground continuation.
- Explicit capture cancellation discards the current recording before persistence. System/lifetime cancellation still retains useful audio. Stale Live Activity cancel actions are scoped by recording UUID.
- Bound a recognition pass to three captures and a six-second timeout each. Prioritize the current capture, then previously unattempted work.
- Persist a match before enqueueing a file-backed background URLSession upload. Reuse matched metadata on delivery retries.
- Display and enqueue each match before slower backlog recognition. Current online identification and upload must not wait for a future invocation.
- Mark delivered only after a valid response confirms the same capture UUID and recording. Retain all unfinished work through network, auth, and malformed-response failures.
- Show missing connection, active upload, scheduled retry, and confirmed delivery separately. Saving a connection enqueues matched captures immediately. Retry persisted deadlines with one timer while the app can run, honoring Retry-After and a 30-second minimum; authentication failures are rechecked on app/Shortcut use, and verified credentials clear stale blocked flags. Enrollment uses an empty capture payload to validate auth without Spotify effects; only the exact authenticated service validation response counts as a successful check.
- Reattach the background URLSession on OS relaunch and finish the OS callback after persistence and notification scheduling. User force quit cancels transfers; explicit subsequent Shortcut/app invocation restores the queue. Do not promise passive reconnect bypasses force quit.
- Notifications use one identifier per capture, a 10-second recognition grace period, and confirmed-delivery replacement. A delayed confirmation replaces that card and alerts again. Persist notification scheduling state; avoid historical-delivery notification floods and keep delivery working if notification authorization is denied.

## Ownership and configuration

Offline Shazam owns its app, local queue, signatures, and device Keychain connection. Music Sync is an intentional shared service through its capture-only HTTP API. It owns Spotify access, client issuance/revocation, and delivery receipts. The app never shares Music Sync's backing storage or provider tokens. Removing this app or revoking its token does not affect other callers. Removing the Music Sync service prevents delivery and leaves the phone's queue intact.

Client enrollment asks only for an HTTPS capture URL and an app-issued bearer token, saved in Keychain. No credentials or personal configuration belong in source, Info.plist, defaults, fixture data, or logs. No app runtime secrets or CI service account are needed in this repository. There is no analytics dependency.
